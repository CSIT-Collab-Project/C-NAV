# CRLS-NAV

Usage:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
If this throws an error try:
```sh
pip uninstall -r requirements.txt
```
and then try the first commands again, and that should fix it.

If developing on a mac or linux system you may need to change the port number in main.py from port 80 to something else (like 8080) as 80 is sometimes restricted depending on permissions.
